#Getch

This module provides a cross-platform solution to get one character from standard input. It works just like `input`. The only exception is that return does not need to be sent. After one character, it automatically stops asking for input.

##Example Usages

	if getch('Are you sure you want to quit without saving changes? (y/N): ').lower() == 'y':
		sys.exit()

	getch('Press any key to continue...')
